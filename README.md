  ## Description
  
 Team Member Generator is a web app that is designed to load team member information and display it on a webpage. After all necessary parts to run this project are installed, the user will be prompted with multiple questions about each member they would like to add, deciding between a manager, interns, and engineers. Once the list of team members is complete, the cards will generate on the HTML page and there will be a notice on the command line of terminal letting the user know the cards have been generated.
